				About me?
			</h2>
			<p class="about__text">
				I'm David and very pleased that you dropped by. I'm located just outside of Kristianstad in the southern parts of Sweden.
			</p>
			<p class="about__text">
				Currently I'm a Front-End Developer student at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, Sweden.
				This is fulltime studies done remotley. 
				I started this journey in the fall of 2022 and will graduate to the summer of 2024. 
			</p>
			<p class="about__text">
				I will be looking for a LIA (internship) for the fall of 2023.
			</p>
			<p class="about__text">
				By that time I will have gone through most of the classes at school so my base skill tree would look something like this:
			</p>
			<div class="about__list__container">
			<ul>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS/SASS</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>TypeScript</li>
				<li>Vite</li>
				<li>Parcel</li>
				<li>Git</li>
				<li>Testing (Jest / Cypress)</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>API-Development</li>
				<li>Node</li>
				<li>NoSQL</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
				<li>React</li>
				<li>Vue</li>
				<li>UI/UX</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="about__text">
				I would atleast concider myself to have basic knowledge of all the above listed techs once I'm off to my first LIA next fall.
			</p>
			<p class="about__text">
				This portfolio was made with Vue, something I at the time of setting the project up had only glimpsed in a previous course and never set up a solo project with. This made up for a challenge, and I like the challenges you get when coding.<br>
				Problems were plenty but seems I got out the other end with some more knowledge than I started with and that's what matters!
